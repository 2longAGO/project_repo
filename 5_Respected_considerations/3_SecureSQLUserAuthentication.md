# Secure SQL User Authentication Considerations

1. [ ] Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of directly embedding user inputs into SQL queries.
2. [ ] Password Storage: Hash and salt user passwords before storing them in the database. Use a strong and slow hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to protect passwords from being easily compromised if the database is breached.
   1. hashAndSaltPassword() has no implementation
3. [ ] Secure Communication: Ensure that all communications between your program and the database are encrypted using SSL/TLS. This prevents eavesdropping and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
   1. The communication is handled by the mysql library.
4. [ ] Principle of Least Privilege: Create a dedicated database user with the least privileges required for your program to function properly. Limit its access to only the necessary tables and operations. Avoid using a superuser account for your program.
5. [X] Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to prevent detailed error messages from being displayed to users. Displaying specific error messages can give attackers valuable information about the system.
   1. Errors related to the sql communication are handled.
6. [ ] Session Management: Implement a secure session management system to handle user sessions and authentication tokens. Use techniques like session expiration, token rotation, and secure storage to mitigate session hijacking and replay attacks.
7. [ ] Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies, such as minimum length, complexity requirements, and password expiration. Educate users about the importance of choosing strong passwords.
8. [ ] Regular Updates and Patching: Keep your database software and libraries up to date with the latest security patches. Vulnerabilities in the database system or its components can be exploited by attackers.
   1. N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
9.  [ ] Access Control: Implement appropriate access control mechanisms at the application level to ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources or perform specific actions.
10. [ ] Logging and Auditing: Implement comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms to track and monitor all significant activities related to user authentication and database operations. This helps in detecting and investigating any security incidents.
11. [ ] Security Testing: Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and fix any vulnerabilities in your program before deploying it in a production environment.
    1. N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
