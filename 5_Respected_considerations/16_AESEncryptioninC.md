# AES Encryption in C++ Considerations

1. [~] Key Management: The security of your AES encryption relies heavily on the secrecy and randomness of the encryption key. Make sure to generate strong random keys and handle them securely. Consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate keys.
   1. Secure generation and no storage
2. [] Key Storage: Ensure that the encryption keys are stored securely. Avoid hardcoding the keys in your code or storing them in plaintext files. Consider using secure key storage mechanisms, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or key management system.
   1. N/A
3. [X] Encryption Mode: Choose an appropriate encryption mode for AES, such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), depending on your requirements. Each mode has its own security characteristics and considerations. Ensure you understand the specific properties and vulnerabilities associated with the chosen mode.
4. [X] Initialization Vector (IV): When using certain modes (e.g., CBC), an initialization vector is required to ensure the uniqueness of the ciphertext. The IV should be random and unique for each encryption operation. Do not reuse the same IV for multiple encryptions with the same key.
5. [ ] Padding: AES operates on fixed-size blocks, so if your plaintext is not a multiple of the block size (128 bits for AES), you need to apply padding. Choose a reliable padding scheme, such as PKCS7, and ensure proper padding validation during decryption to avoid padding oracle attacks.
6. [ ] Authentication and Integrity: AES alone only provides confidentiality; it does not guarantee integrity or authenticity. To ensure data integrity, consider using a message authentication code (MAC) or a secure hash function, such as HMAC-SHA256, to verify the integrity of the ciphertext. This helps protect against tampering and unauthorized modifications.
7. [ ] Secure Memory Handling: Take care to securely handle sensitive data, such as encryption keys and plaintexts, in memory. Avoid leaving plaintexts or keys in memory longer than necessary. When done with sensitive data, overwrite it or clear the memory to minimize the risk of memory-based attacks.
8. [ ] Secure Input/Output Handling: Ensure that the input and output operations are performed securely. Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent attacks like buffer overflows or injection attacks. Use secure channels (e.g., SSL/TLS) for transmitting encrypted data to prevent eavesdropping or tampering during transmission.
9.  [ ] Peer Review: It is always recommended to have your code reviewed by a peer or an expert in cryptography. A fresh set of eyes can help identify potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that you might have missed.
   1.  N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
10. [ ] Keep Up with Security Updates: AES is a well-studied and widely used encryption algorithm, but new vulnerabilities or attacks may be discovered over time. Stay updated with the latest security advisories, patches, and best practices related to AES encryption to address any emerging security concerns.

Note that this example uses the OpenSSL library for AES encryption, random number generation, and HMAC-SHA256 computation. Make sure to link against the OpenSSL library (`-lcrypto`) when compiling the program.

Remember to always thoroughly test and validate your code, as well as seek professional guidance, when implementing security-sensitive systems.
