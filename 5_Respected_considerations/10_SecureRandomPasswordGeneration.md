# Secure Random Password Generation Considerations

1. [~] Password Length: Longer passwords are generally more secure. Consider generating passwords with a minimum length of at least 12 characters.
   1. by default 12 long
2. [X] Character Composition: Include a variety of character types in the password, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This increases the password's complexity and makes it harder to guess or crack.
3. [~] Randomness: Use a secure random number generator or cryptographic library to generate random characters. Avoid using predictable sources like pseudo-random number generators or system timestamps.
   1. The random number generator is questionable
4. [X] Avoid Common Patterns: Avoid generating passwords that follow common patterns or sequences, such as "123456" or "password". These are easily guessable and vulnerable to dictionary-based attacks.
5. [X] Avoid Personal Information: Ensure that the generated password doesn't include any personal information such as names, birthdates, or other easily guessable details. Attackers may try to exploit known information about the user.
6. [X] Avoid Dictionary Words: Avoid using dictionary words or common phrases as passwords. Hackers often use automated tools that can quickly try combinations of dictionary words.
7. [ ] Password Storage: If you are storing the generated passwords, ensure that you follow secure practices for storing passwords, such as using strong encryption, salting, and hashing algorithms.
8. [ ] Avoid Hardcoding: Avoid hardcoding the generated password in the program or storing it in plain text. Instead, provide a way for the user to securely retrieve or reset the password.
9.  [ ] Password Strength Requirements: If the passwords are for a specific system or service, check the password strength requirements specified by that system. Some systems may enforce specific rules, such as a minimum length or restrictions on certain characters.
10. [ ] User Education: Encourage users to follow good password practices, such as not reusing passwords, regularly changing them, and using a password manager to securely store their passwords.
    1. N/A can't be done entirely within the confines of the code

### Code

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12):
    # Define the character composition for the password
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

    # Generate a random password with the specified length
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))

    return password

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Prompt the user for the desired password length
    length = int(input("Enter the desired password length: "))

    # Generate the password
    password = generate_password(length)

    # Print the generated password
    print("Generated Password:", password)

```

This program uses the `random` module to generate random characters from a predefined set of characters. It takes an optional argument `length` to specify the desired password length.

The `string` module provides a collection of constants containing letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation characters. By combining these characters, we create a pool of characters from which the password is generated.

Note that this program is a basic implementation and doesn't include features such as storing the password securely or enforcing specific password strength requirements. These aspects would depend on the specific requirements of your application or system.
