# FTP Server Security Considerations in Cpp

1. [ ] Secure Authentication: Implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the FTP server. Use secure protocols like FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) that provide encryption for authentication and data transmission.

1. [ ] Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies for user accounts, requiring complex passwords that include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Encourage users to regularly update their passwords.
   1. Not specifically mentioned but implied by the same comment as for number 1
2. [ ] Limited Privileges: Grant users the minimum necessary privileges required to perform their tasks. Avoid using a single superuser account and instead assign unique accounts to individuals with access restrictions based on their role and responsibilities.
3. [ ] Network Segmentation: Isolate the FTP server from other critical systems by placing it within a separate network segment or using a firewall to restrict access to authorized IPs only. This helps mitigate the risk of lateral movement in case of a breach.
4. [ ] Secure File Transfers: Implement secure protocols like FTPS or SFTP that encrypt data in transit. These protocols provide confidentiality and integrity, protecting files from eavesdropping and tampering during transmission.

5. [ ] Encryption at Rest: Consider encrypting files stored on the FTP server's dedicated folder to protect them from unauthorized access if the server is compromised. Encrypting the data ensures that even if the files are accessed, they remain unreadable without the encryption key.
6. [ ] Regular Updates and Patching: Keep the FTP server software up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Vulnerabilities in the server software can be exploited by attackers, so prompt patching is essential to address any known security issues.
   1. N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
7. [ ] Monitoring and Logging: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track FTP server activity, including login attempts, file transfers, and access control changes. Analyzing logs can help detect suspicious activities, potential breaches, or unauthorized access attempts.
8. [ ] Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Utilize intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns or known attack signatures. IDPS can detect and block unauthorized access attempts or other malicious activities.
9.  [ ] Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in the FTP server's configuration, policies, or implementation. Address any identified vulnerabilities promptly.
    1. N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
10. [ ] User Education: Educate users about security best practices, such as not sharing their credentials, using strong passwords, and being cautious of phishing attempts. Awareness training can help reduce the risk of social engineering attacks.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>
#include <filesystem>

// Add necessary headers for FTP server implementation and encryption

using namespace std;
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

// Constants
const string FTP_FOLDER = "/path/to/ftp/folder"; // Specify the path to the dedicated FTP folder

// Function to handle file upload
void handleUpload(const string& fileName, const string& filePath)
{
    // Verify user authentication and authorization here
    
    // Implement secure file transfer (e.g., FTPS or SFTP) for uploading
    
    // Save the uploaded file to the FTP folder
    fs::path destinationPath = fs::path(FTP_FOLDER) / fileName;
    fs::copy_file(filePath, destinationPath, fs::copy_options::overwrite_existing);
    
    // Provide appropriate response to the user
    // For example, send a success message or notify any errors that occurred
}

// Function to handle file download
void handleDownload(const string& fileName)
{
    // Verify user authentication and authorization here
    
    // Implement secure file transfer (e.g., FTPS or SFTP) for downloading
    
    // Retrieve the requested file from the FTP folder
    fs::path sourcePath = fs::path(FTP_FOLDER) / fileName;
    
    // Check if the file exists and is accessible
    if (fs::exists(sourcePath) && fs::is_regular_file(sourcePath))
    {
        // Provide the file for download
        // For example, stream the file content to the user or initiate a download link
    }
    else
    {
        // File not found or not accessible, provide appropriate response to the user
        // For example, send an error message or notify the user about the issue
    }
}

int main()
{
    // Initialize the FTP server here
    
    // Accept incoming connections and handle client requests
    
    // Example usage of the handleUpload and handleDownload functions
    string action, fileName, filePath;
    cout << "Enter action (upload/download): ";
    cin >> action;
    
    if (action == "upload")
    {
        cout << "Enter file name: ";
        cin >> fileName;
        cout << "Enter file path: ";
        cin >> filePath;
        
        handleUpload(fileName, filePath);
    }
    else if (action == "download")
    {
        cout << "Enter file name: ";
        cin >> fileName;
        
        handleDownload(fileName);
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "Invalid action specified.";
    }
    
    return 0;
