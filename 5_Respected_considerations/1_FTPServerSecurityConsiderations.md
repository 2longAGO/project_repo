# FTP Server Security Considerations

1. [ ] Secure Authentication: Implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the FTP server. Use secure protocols like FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) that provide encryption for authentication and data transmission.
   1. Authorization handled by DummyAuthorizer.
2. [ ] Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies for user accounts, requiring complex passwords that include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Encourage users to regularly update their passwords.

3. [X] Limited Privileges: Grant users the minimum necessary privileges required to perform their tasks. Avoid using a single superuser account and instead assign unique accounts to individuals with access restrictions based on their role and responsibilities.
   1. The account can only be generated on code in this implementation
4. [X] Network Segmentation: Isolate the FTP server from other critical systems by placing it within a separate network segment or using a firewall to restrict access to authorized IPs only. This helps mitigate the risk of lateral movement in case of a breach.

5. [ ] Secure File Transfers: Implement secure protocols like FTPS or SFTP that encrypt data in transit. These protocols provide confidentiality and integrity, protecting files from eavesdropping and tampering during transmission.
   1. Not implemented, should have used TLS_FTPHandler.
6. [ ] Encryption at Rest: Consider encrypting files stored on the FTP server's dedicated folder to protect them from unauthorized access if the server is compromised. Encrypting the data ensures that even if the files are accessed, they remain unreadable without the encryption key.

7. [ ] Regular Updates and Patching: Keep the FTP server software up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Vulnerabilities in the server software can be exploited by attackers, so prompt patching is essential to address any known security issues.
   1. N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
8. [ ] Monitoring and Logging: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track FTP server activity, including login attempts, file transfers, and access control changes. Analyzing logs can help detect suspicious activities, potential breaches, or unauthorized access attempts.
   1. N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
9.  [ ] Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Utilize intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns or known attack signatures. IDPS can detect and block unauthorized access attempts or other malicious activities.
10. [ ] Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in the FTP server's configuration, policies, or implementation. Address any identified vulnerabilities promptly.
    1. N/A can't be done within the confines of the code
11. [ ] User Education: Educate users about security best practices, such as not sharing their credentials, using strong passwords, and being cautious of phishing attempts. Awareness training can help reduce the risk of social engineering attacks.

### Code

```python
import os
from pyftpdlib.authorizers import DummyAuthorizer
from pyftpdlib.handlers import FTPHandler
from pyftpdlib.servers import FTPServer

# Configuration
FTP_HOST = '0.0.0.0'  # FTP server host (all available interfaces)
FTP_PORT = 2121  # FTP server port
FTP_ROOT = '/path/to/ftp/folder'  # Root folder for FTP server

# Create a dummy authorizer for managing user accounts and permissions
authorizer = DummyAuthorizer()

# Define a user account with a password and specific permissions
authorizer.add_user('username', 'password', FTP_ROOT, perm='elradfmw')

# Optionally, restrict user permissions to a specific IP address
authorizer.add_anonymous(FTP_ROOT, perm='elr')

# Create an FTP handler and configure it with the authorizer
handler = FTPHandler
handler.authorizer = authorizer

# Configure FTP server to use SSL/TLS
handler.tls_control_required = True
handler.certfile = '/path/to/ssl_certificate.pem'
handler.tls_data_required = True

# Limit passive port range for data connections (optional)
handler.passive_ports = range(30000, 30010)

# Enable logging (optional)
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='/path/to/ftp_server.log', level=logging.INFO)

# Disable anonymous login (optional)
handler.enable_logging = False

# Instantiate and start the FTP server
server = FTPServer((FTP_HOST, FTP_PORT), handler)
server.serve_forever()

```
