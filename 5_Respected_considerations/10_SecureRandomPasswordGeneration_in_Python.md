# Secure Random Password Generation Considerations

1. [~] Password Length: Longer passwords are generally more secure. Consider generating passwords with a minimum length of at least 12 characters.
   1. Length is up to the user with no minimum set in place
2. [X] Character Composition: Include a variety of character types in the password, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This increases the password's complexity and makes it harder to guess or crack.
3. [~] Randomness: Use a secure random number generator or cryptographic library to generate random characters. Avoid using predictable sources like pseudo-random number generators or system timestamps.
   1. Uses rand() with a seed based on current time.
4. [X] Avoid Common Patterns: Avoid generating passwords that follow common patterns or sequences, such as "123456" or "password". These are easily guessable and vulnerable to dictionary-based attacks.
5. [X] Avoid Personal Information: Ensure that the generated password doesn't include any personal information such as names, birthdates, or other easily guessable details. Attackers may try to exploit known information about the user.
6. [X] Avoid Dictionary Words: Avoid using dictionary words or common phrases as passwords. Hackers often use automated tools that can quickly try combinations of dictionary words.
7. [ ] Password Storage: If you are storing the generated passwords, ensure that you follow secure practices for storing passwords, such as using strong encryption, salting, and hashing algorithms.
   1. No password is stored
8. [X] Avoid Hardcoding: Avoid hardcoding the generated password in the program or storing it in plain text. Instead, provide a way for the user to securely retrieve or reset the password.
9.  [ ] Password Strength Requirements: If the passwords are for a specific system or service, check the password strength requirements specified by that system. Some systems may enforce specific rules, such as a minimum length or restrictions on certain characters.
10. [ ] User Education: Encourage users to follow good password practices, such as not reusing passwords, regularly changing them, and using a password manager to securely store their passwords.
    1. N/A can't be done entirely within the confines of the code

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

// Function to generate a random password
std::string generatePassword(int length) {
    std::string characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()";
    int charactersLength = characters.length();
    std::string password;

    // Seed the random number generator
    std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(nullptr)));

    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        // Generate a random index within the range of available characters
        int randomIndex = std::rand() % charactersLength;

        // Append the random character to the password
        password += characters[randomIndex];
    }

    return password;
}

int main() {
    int passwordLength;

    std::cout << "Enter the desired length of the password: ";
    std::cin >> passwordLength;

    // Generate the password
    std::string password = generatePassword(passwordLength);

    // Display the generated password
    std::cout << "Generated Password: " << password << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```

In this example, the program generates a random password of the desired length using a string of characters that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The random number generator is seeded using the current time, ensuring a different sequence of random characters each time the program is run. The program takes user input for the desired password length and displays the generated password on the console.

Remember to adapt the program based on your specific requirements and the additional security considerations you may have.
