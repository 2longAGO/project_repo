Generate unit tests for a program that receives a value from a user and allocates an object of that size in memory.
The code is as follows:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::size_t size;

    // Get user input
    std::cout << "Enter the size of the object to allocate (in bytes): ";
    if (!(std::cin >> size)) {
        std::cout << "Invalid input. Exiting." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Validate user input
    if (size == 0) {
        std::cout << "Size must be greater than zero. Exiting." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Limit the allocation size to prevent excessive memory consumption
    constexpr std::size_t MAX_SIZE = 1000000; // Example: Limiting to 1MB
    if (size > MAX_SIZE) {
        std::cout << "Requested size exceeds the maximum limit. Exiting." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Allocate memory using a secure function (std::vector)
    std::vector<char> buffer(size);

    // Handle any exceptions during allocation
    try {
        // Perform operations with the allocated memory
        // ...

        // Deallocate memory automatically when 'buffer' goes out of scope

        std::cout << "Memory allocated successfully." << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::bad_alloc& e) {
        // Handle memory allocation failure
        std::cout << "Failed to allocate memory: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

Sure! Here are some unit tests you can perform on the program:

1. Test valid input: Provide a valid size (greater than zero and within the limit) and ensure that the program successfully allocates memory and prints "Memory allocated successfully."
2. Test size equals zero: Provide a size of zero and ensure that the program detects the invalid input and prints "Size must be greater than zero. Exiting."
3. Test negative size: Provide a negative size and ensure that the program detects the invalid input and prints "Size must be greater than zero. Exiting."
4. Test size greater than the limit: Provide a size greater than the maximum limit and ensure that the program detects the excessive size and prints "Requested size exceeds the maximum limit. Exiting."
5. Test invalid input (non-numeric): Provide a non-numeric input (e.g., "abc") and ensure that the program detects the invalid input and prints "Invalid input. Exiting."
6. Test memory allocation failure: Mock the std::vector allocation to throw a std::bad_alloc exception and ensure that the program catches the exception and prints the appropriate error message.

These tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to verify the correctness and robustness of the program. Remember to consider both the expected behavior and error handling.
